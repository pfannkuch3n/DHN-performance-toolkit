# Page: 9 - Zulässige Massenströme bei einem Druckverlust von 60-80 Pa/m Rohrlänge
# Date extracted: 2025
# Units: DN [designation], wall_thickness [m], inner_diameter [m], mass_flow [kg/s], pressure_drop [Pa/m] (SI units)
#
# Pressure Drop Information:
# - pressure_drop_min: Minimum recommended pressure drop (60 Pa/m)
# - pressure_drop_max: Maximum recommended pressure drop (80 Pa/m)
# - Manufacturer curve automatically built from these values
